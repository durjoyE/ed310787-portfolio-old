                                <em>My Time at Deepwater: a Retrospective</em> is a social commentary over the poor treatment of my junior high by students from our sister schools. The video was created as an English project in May of 2020, a bit after the first wave of COVID-19 hit; as such, I produced it entirely at home.
                                <br>
                                The assignment stated I was allowed to criticize the school distict and its schools, if I liked. I realized this was finally an opportunity to give my friends a voice against the others, as we were seen as inferior and just stupid because our school, Deepwater, was primarily attended by Hispanic students.

                                <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <h2>
                                creating this project
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                For the longest time, this project was just sitting on my to-do list. I knew I wanted to make a video for the assignment, and I had written the introductory paragraph in Notion. I created a small title animation using the school logos and dropped it into Premiere. I did some research about school statistics and browsed for pictures I could use as visual aid to the intro. I'd also asked a few friends about some significant memories of discrimination they'd experienced in our junior high years and written some testimony, but that was all.
                                <br>
                                Then around four days before it was finally due, I decided to double down on it, and crunched the script out in one night. I didn't have a professional mic, so I went into my closet to record the voiceover on my phone in my closet.
                                <br>
                                At this point, it was a weekend before the video needed to be ready to submit on Monday night. I shifted into overdrive and started to edit non-stop for two days. I worked on each chapter of the video before moving on to the next. I trimmed pops from my voiceover and timed it to the music tracks I had picked out. Then, I started to gather the visuals for what I would be saying at what time. I had already gatherd some information of the schools' student stats from public educational record sites. I looked mostly for stock footage to pair with the words. 
                                <br>
                                I rendered a couple of test clips and sent them to a few of my close friends to gather feedback of what I should change. I also finalized the testimony I'd gotten and made After Effects comps for the quotes to scroll along with the voiceover. 
                                <br>
                                Monday night, at around ten o'clock, I published and submitted the final video. The video's original audience was pretty much my English teacher and a few of my friends that attended Deepwater with me, but its reach went far beyond that. I began receiving praise from peers from all over the district, old teachers, and even school board members, who had somehow obtained it.
                                <br>
                                This video is one I'm quite proud of. Creating it with a passion to give Deepwater kids a voice helped its fruition greatly.

                                - This was my first time working in Audition where I used the mixes in an overarching project <br>
                                - This was also the first time I used the big four Adobe programs in tandem with one another, utilizing Dynamic Link to make the process quicker <br>
                                - I found an efficient Notion workflow to organize my script, research, b-roll/visual list, and video checklist in one place <br>
                            </p>

                                - The voiceover mixing and my voice's energy varies througout the video <br>
                                - The stroke I applied to the schools' logos ruined the form, and didn't look very nice in general <br>
                                - I started a bit too late, probably. Had I given myself even a few more days, I could've polished up the video more
